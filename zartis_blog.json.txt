        "content": "<p>Published by <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com\">Zartis - Software Engineering Teams &amp; Technology Consulting</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI agents are reshaping how businesses operate, offering complex task automation that enhances efficiency while ensuring more intelligent decision-making. From handling routine tasks to surfacing insights that guide strategic actions, AI’s role in modern business is rapidly expanding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Zartis, we are actively exploring AI-driven solutions across multiple departments — from software engineering to operations, finance, HR, and beyond. One key area where AI has significant potential is for our Growth Team, which encompasses both our sales and marketing functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our business, for our Growth Team, success depends on human connection. Timely, relevant, and personalised engagement with existing and potential clients. This includes reaching out when key changes happen — such as a contact changing jobs, a company announcing major news, or a prospect engaging with thought leadership content. However, scaling this level of engagement manually is nearly impossible.</span></p>\n<p><b>That’s where AI agents come in. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our approach is focused on leveraging AI to intelligently surface opportunities for outreach, ensuring we connect with the right people at the right time, without creating unnecessary noise. Some parts of this initiative are still a work in progress, but we are already seeing how AI can enhance prospect nurturing, reduce manual effort, and improve data accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we’ll walk through how we are building AI-powered workflows for prospect engagement, the challenges we are solving, and the key metrics we are tracking as we refine this approach.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Challenge: Scaling Personalised Outreach Without Noise</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong sales and marketing strategy depends on </span><b>relevance and timing</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The best outreach is not just well-written — it’s </span><b>context-aware</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning it happens when something meaningful has changed for the prospect. Whether it’s a hiring need, a new job, a company milestone, or an engagement with thought leadership, context is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, keeping track of these events manually is difficult, especially at scale. We knew, you can try but things are bound to slip you at some point. Some of the key challenges include:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>1. Tracking Relevant Triggers in Real-Time</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contacts change jobs, companies evolve, and industry news breaks daily.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identifying the right moment to reach out without spending hours researching is challenging.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Balancing Automation and Personalisation</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional automation tools help with email sequences but lack true context awareness.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge is to automate only what makes sense, keeping outreach personal and relevant rather than robotic.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. Avoiding Overcommunication or Spam</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Zartis, we’ve never seen the value in guerrilla outreach strategies or cold outreach for the sake of it. Over the years we’ve learned that creating real connections and nurturing them is what really works. So, one of the biggest considerations we had was to make sure we don’t alienate our network by bombarding them with semi-relevant content that adds little value to their lives.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales and marketing teams risk overloading prospects with messages if they automate without a smart strategy.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI needs to act as a smart filter, ensuring outreach adds value rather than creating noise.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>4. Maintaining CRM Data Accuracy</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdated information leads to poor engagement (e.g., congratulating someone on a job they left six months ago).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI can play a key role in automatically updating CRM records based on external data signals.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of our AI-powered prospect nurturing initiative is to solve these challenges, ensuring that every outreach is:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Timely</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Triggered by meaningful events.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Personalised</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Tailored to the individual or company.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Non-intrusive</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Adding value rather than overwhelming prospects.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AI-Powered Growth Strategy</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To solve the challenges of timely, personalised, and scalable prospect engagement, we are implementing AI-powered workflows that integrate real-time data insights with automated but meaningful outreach. Our approach focuses on three key pillars:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>1. Data-Driven Insights for Engagement</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is only as good as the data it processes. To make informed outreach decisions, we integrate multiple external data sources into our HubSpot CRM, ensuring that relevant updates about prospects and companies are surfaced automatically. These sources include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Career Sites </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– Job openings, job changes, promotions, and company moves.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Industry News Platforms</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Google Alerts, Crunchbase, and Owler for company updates.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Thought Leadership Engagement</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Tracking interactions and analysing which Zartis content may be useful for them. This involves our plans to infer interests from company tech stacks, which we can link to recent job openings and use that in multiple ways.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By having this data automatically aggregated and structured, we can identify the right moments to reach out — without sales or marketing teams having to manually search for updates.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Automation for Timely Outreach</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once AI detects a key update, the next step is triggering the right action. Instead of generic, mass outreach, our AI agents create personalised engagement workflows that include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Task Creation:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Assigning follow-ups to the right team member (aka the contact owner on HubSpot).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Personalised Messaging:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drafting emails that reference the latest prospect updates, prepared to be reviewed by the contact owner of the lead in our CRM.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>CRM Updates:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ensuring records stay accurate, reducing manual data entry and updates.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a prospect changes jobs, AI detects this update via LinkedIn data and:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updates the prospect’s new role in the CRM.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creates a task for the Growth Team to send a personalised message to congratulate them on the change.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drafts a congratulatory email with relevant content about their new industry or role.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. Aligning Outreach with Thought Leadership</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI also plays a role in content-driven engagement, ensuring prospects receive valuable insights rather than just sales messages. Our AI agents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Match Zartis blog content to a prospect’s industry or interests.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recommend articles to sales reps inside HubSpot for easy sharing.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule periodic follow-ups with relevant thought leadership, reinforcing relationships. And this is not a set up and forget type of a system. The AI agents are configured to remind the team every 3 months if a contact has not been reached out to since then. This allows us to come up with meaningful and periodic interactions, unique to that person.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This strategy ensures that AI-powered outreach is not just about sales; it’s about value. By focusing on timely, insightful engagement, we can build stronger connections without overwhelming prospects with irrelevant messages.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Features of Our AI-Powered Prospect Nurturing</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our AI-driven approach to prospect nurturing is centred around surfacing relevant, actionable insights at the right time, while minimising manual effort for our Growth Team. Below are the core features we are implementing:</span></p>\n<h4><b>1. Job Changes: Timely and Personalised Outreach</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI detects when a prospect changes jobs by pulling data from LinkedIn and other sources. Instead of a generic &#8220;Congrats on the new role!&#8221; message, AI ensures that outreach is contextually relevant by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updating the CRM with new job details.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drafting a personalised email that acknowledges the change while connecting it to how we can support them in their new role.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping sales and marketing teams prioritise outreach, ensuring key prospects don’t go unnoticed.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Company &amp; Sector News: Engaging When It Matters</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI monitors news sources, funding announcements, product launches, and industry trends, ensuring our Growth Team can engage when there’s a relevant development.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a prospect’s company announces a funding round, AI triggers an internal notification suggesting a strategic outreach message about scaling teams efficiently.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a company enters a new market, AI recommends content related to international expansion from our blog.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These insights are automatically added to HubSpot, making it easy for the team to act on them.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. Birthdays &amp; Cultural Events: Strengthening Relationships</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People appreciate thoughtful gestures. AI helps track birthdays, work anniversaries, and cultural events for more meaningful engagement.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It stores key dates in HubSpot and automatically suggests personalised messages.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a prospect celebrates a major cultural holiday, AI recommends an appropriate engagement strategy, ensuring outreach is both timely and respectful.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>4. Offering Relevant Thought Leadership, Not Just Content</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than blindly sending blog links, AI builds an interest profile for each prospect, considering:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their role, industry, and past interactions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their company’s recent activities and focus areas.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broader market trends that might be relevant to them.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By doing so, it ensures that every piece of content we share answers a real question or challenge they are facing, making interactions more valuable.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: AI-Powered Engagement Based on Company Growth</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of focusing on job changes (as covered earlier), let’s consider another real-world scenario:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company raises new funding.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI detects this from Crunchbase, Owler, or Google Alerts.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI updates the CRM, noting the funding round and potential business growth.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI recommends a strategic outreach angle—for example:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the company is expanding its tech team, AI suggests a conversation about scaling development teams efficiently.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they mention AI investment, AI prompts the Growth Team to share insights on AI adoption strategies.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI generates a tailored message for the sales or marketing team to review and personalise before sending.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By surfacing strategic engagement opportunities, AI helps us stay proactive rather than reactive. It ensures we are always engaging with prospects at the right time, in a way that is genuinely valuable and not intrusive.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measuring Success: Key Metrics to Track</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since our AI-driven prospect nurturing initiative is still a work in progress, our focus is on defining the right success metrics rather than drawing firm conclusions just yet. To measure the impact of AI on our Growth Team’s effectiveness, we are tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) in three critical areas:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>1. Task Adoption</b></h4>\n<h4><b>Are AI-Generated Insights Being Used?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the simplest ways to measure effectiveness is by tracking whether AI-generated outreach translates into action.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many AI-created tasks are completed by the team?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are sales and marketing teams engaging with AI-suggested prospects?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which AI-generated tasks are most useful, and which are ignored?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By monitoring adoption, we can refine the system, ensuring that AI prioritises the most relevant engagement opportunities and reduces unnecessary task creation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Engagement Quality</b></h4>\n<h4><b>Are We Reaching the Right People in the Right Way?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While automation can improve efficiency, outreach is only valuable if it leads to meaningful conversations. We track engagement quality by looking at:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email open and response rates for AI-suggested messages.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting conversion rates: how often AI-triggered outreach leads to a scheduled call.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalisation effectiveness: whether AI-generated messages require significant manual tweaking or are ready to send as-is.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These indicators help us determine whether AI is delivering relevant outreach opportunities rather than just automating for the sake of efficiency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. Pipeline Impact</b></h4>\n<h4><b>Is AI Helping Us Generate and Nurture Leads?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the goal of AI-driven prospect engagement is to support business growth. We evaluate its impact on the sales pipeline by tracking:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of deals influenced by AI-powered outreach.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact of AI-driven nurturing on conversion rates.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead movement through the funnel—whether AI-triggered touchpoints help revive cold leads or accelerate warm ones.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because relationship-building in B2B sales is a long-term effort, some of these metrics will take time to fully materialise. However, early indicators, such as increased engagement, improved task completion, and stronger pipeline movement, will signal whether AI is helping us build meaningful connections with prospects.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>4. CRM Data Accuracy: Are We Reducing Manual Effort and Improving Data Quality?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A secondary but equally important goal of this initiative is improving CRM data hygiene by reducing outdated or incorrect information. We track:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The accuracy of AI-updated prospect records.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reductions in manual data entry.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How often AI catches and corrects outdated job roles or company affiliations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If AI can keep our CRM updated without manual intervention, it will free up valuable time for our Growth Team, allowing them to focus on relationship-building rather than data entry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By continuously iterating based on these metrics, we aim to refine our approach, ensuring that AI enhances our sales and marketing efforts rather than replacing the human element.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion: The Future of AI in Growth Teams</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our exploration into AI-driven prospect nurturing is not just about automation for efficiency, it’s about making engagement more relevant, valuable, and well-timed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leveraging AI agents, we can:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify key moments to reach out, ensuring prospects receive messages when they matter most.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automate time-consuming research tasks, allowing our Growth Team to focus on relationships.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain clean, up-to-date CRM records, reducing manual data entry.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Align content recommendations with actual prospect needs, making outreach more insightful.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we refine our AI-powered workflows, we are keeping a few key lessons in mind:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>1. AI Should Enhance, Not Replace, Human Interaction</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal is not to let AI fully automate prospect engagement—it’s to empower sales and marketing teams with better insights. AI helps us scale personalisation, but the human touch remains critical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, while AI can draft a congratulatory email for a job change, a sales rep should add a personal anecdote or tailored touch point to make it feel authentic and meaningful.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Balancing Automation and Relevance is Crucial</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key risk with AI-driven outreach is over-automation, where prospects receive too many messages or engagement feels impersonal. To avoid this, we are refining how often AI triggers outreach so it remains valuable, not intrusive. Most importantly, our AI agents for the Growth team require human oversight before AI-generated messages are sent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, ensuring AI suggests insightful, high-value touchpoints, rather than just automating for the sake of automation is the key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking this measured approach, we can build trust and credibility rather than simply increasing the volume of outreach.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. The Future: Expanding AI’s Role in Predictive Engagement</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue testing and optimising our AI-powered workflows, we see future opportunities to enhance our approach:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Predictive Outreach</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Using AI to forecast when a prospect is likely to engage—before they even make a move.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deeper Content Matching</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Refining AI-driven content recommendations so that insights feel even more tailored.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cross-Department AI Integration</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Applying learnings from the Growth Team’s AI use case to other areas of the business.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we refine our approach, we are excited to see how AI can help us build stronger relationships, generate real value for prospects, and ultimately support business growth in a scalable, non-intrusive way.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>What’s Next?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re interested in leveraging AI to enhance your sales and marketing efforts, we’d love to hear from you.

His expertise lies in leading cross-functional engineers, building high performing teams, and optimizing engineering processes. Jassim is here today to talk about mindset, both from a leadership and team perspective.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Power of Mindset in Software Engineering and Leadership</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Success in software development goes beyond writing great code; it requires the right mindset. Whether you&#8217;re an engineer aspiring to lead or a hiring manager building a strong team, how you think, adapt, and approach challenges is crucial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a fast-evolving industry, a growth mindset fosters problem-solving, innovation, and resilience.  For engineers, this means embracing learning and challenges. For leaders, it’s about empowering teams and creating a supportive environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, we explore how mindset plays a pivotal role in career transitions, hiring decisions, and navigating challenges in the fast-paced world of software development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some highlights of this episode include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from Individual Contributor to Leadership</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Role of Mindset in Software Development Success</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring for Mindset Rather than Just Skills</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating High-Pressure Situations &amp; Tight Deadlines</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Servant Leadership as a Core Management Philosophy</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><i>Q:In your experience, what mindset shifts can help teams navigate high-pressure situations or tight deadlines?</i></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In my opinion, the first and most important step is to stay calm &#8211; both as a team and as a leader. Avoid panic, take a step back, and reassess priorities. If multiple priorities are coming together, work closely with stakeholders to align expectations. Remember, effective communication is key. Having the right mindset means being able to communicate clearly and ensure that stakeholders receive the right information to build consensus.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When dealing with a project with a tight deadline, the key to success is slicing or breaking it down into manageable phases. Identify what can be shortened, adjusted, or realistically delivered within the given timeframe. Sometimes, the business may set tight deadlines with a broad scope, but it is the team’s responsibility to help stakeholders understand that a month’s worth of work cannot be completed in a day. However, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) can be delivered to provide value and gather feedback.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these situations, having the right mindset is crucial: focus on work breakdown, slicing, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery. These principles ensure that even under pressure, progress remains steady and achievable.&#8221;</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to the Story of Software on:</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-story-of-software/id1523628863?uo=4\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1vBoa64F7Lg6NOthcCqzbB\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.deezer.com/en/show/1511592\">Deezer</a>, &amp; any other podcast platform of your choice.

        "content": "<p>Published by <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com\">Zartis - Software Engineering Teams &amp; Technology Consulting</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a world where decisions are made not just based on gut feelings but on a deep understanding of vast amounts of data. Yes, we are talking about <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/tech-consulting/ai-services/\">AI services</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-driven decision-making</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fundamental shift in how organisations, industries, and even individuals leverage massive amounts of data for critical decisions. This is the promise of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-driven</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decision-making, a powerful tool transforming how businesses operate and individuals make choices.</span></p>\n<p><b>At its core, AI in decision-making combines data analysis and predictive modelling to improve the quality and speed of decisions.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Here&#8217;s a simplified breakdown:  </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Data Gathering:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AI systems collect massive amounts of data from various sources, such as customer interactions, market trends, and internal operations.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Data Analysis:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Powerful algorithms sift through this data, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships that might be invisible to humans.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Predictive Modeling:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AI systems can predict future outcomes with varying degrees of certainty. For example, they can forecast sales, predict customer churn, or assess the risk of a particular decision.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Decision Support:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The </span><a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/us-artificial-intelligence-regulations-in-2025-a-concise-summary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presents its findings to decision-makers in a clear and understandable format, often through visualisations and reports.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Decision Making:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ultimately, humans still play a crucial role. They use AI-generated insights to inform their decisions, considering the potential risks and rewards. If you take it a step further, you could be defining the parameters for AI to make data-based decisions, so you practically offload the whole process. However, this is only advised when it comes to lower level decisions that are meant to ease your work still, such as classifying leads or customers based on where they are in their buying journey.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>What Can AI Do with Data Across Different Scenarios?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The essence of AI lies in its ability to absorb, analyse, and act on data.

Below are key challenges and AI solutions.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Data Overload and Complexity</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast amount of data businesses collect can be overwhelming, making it hard to extract relevant insights. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI can handle large datasets efficiently, identifying patterns and trends through machine learning. It simplifies data by aggregating it from various sources and presenting only the most relevant information for decision-makers.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Human Bias in Decision Making</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human decision-makers are often influenced by biases like confirmation bias, which can lead to poor decisions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI removes bias by analysing data objectively. Machine learning algorithms provide rational insights based on facts, reducing subjective influences and ensuring more impartial decision-making.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Slow Decision-Making Process</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional decision-making is often slow due to manual analysis and expert consultations, especially in fast-paced environments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI speeds up decision-making by offering real-time data analysis and immediate insights. Predictive analytics help businesses anticipate trends and make timely decisions, improving responsiveness in competitive markets.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Lack of Predictive Insights</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying on historical data can hinder a business’s ability to predict future outcomes. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI’s machine learning and deep learning techniques forecast future trends with high accuracy, providing businesses with valuable predictive insights to drive proactive decisions.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Inconsistent Decision Quality Across Teams</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In larger organisations, different teams may approach decisions in inconsistent ways, leading to inefficiencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI standardised decision-making by providing consistent, data-driven insights across teams, ensuring alignment, and improving overall decision quality by promoting best practices from similar industries.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Inability to Integrate Multiple Data Sources</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data often resides in silos, making it difficult to get a full view of the situation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI integrates data from multiple sources, creating a comprehensive picture that supports well-rounded decision-making. It identifies relationships between disparate datasets, offering new insights and opportunities.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Over-reliance on Past Data</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying too heavily on historical data can be problematic, especially in rapidly evolving markets. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI adapts to new data through continuous learning, ensuring decisions reflect the most current information. It helps businesses adjust strategies in real time based on emerging trends and sudden changes in demand.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Lack of Transparency in Decision-Making</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional decision-making processes may lack transparency, leading to confusion or distrust. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI enhances transparency by providing clear, data-backed reasons for every decision. It tracks inputs and algorithms, creating an audit trail that fosters trust and aids regulatory compliance.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Key Takeaways:</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-driven decision-making is not about replacing human judgment but rather augmenting it with data-driven insights and automation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/ai-copilot-tools-for-developers/comparison-of-tools/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">success of AI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-driven decision-making depends on the quality of data, the sophistication of algorithms, and the appropriate level of human oversight.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of AI-driven decision-making across various industries.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-driven decision-making transforms how businesses approach challenges and opportunities, going beyond simple task automation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI helps interpret complex datasets, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights that may not be immediately visible.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By providing actionable recommendations, AI enables faster, more informed decisions that lead to improved outcomes.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI processes large amounts of data quickly, significantly enhancing decision-making speed and accuracy.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With AI, businesses can make more precise, data-driven decisions &#8211; reducing errors, and improving performance.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI uncovers hidden insights by analysing data from multiple sources, revealing previously inaccessible information.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging AI helps drive business transformation, empowering smarter, more effective decision-making across operations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path forward lies in embracing AI as a tool and as a strategy partner, enabling smarter, faster, and more impactful decisions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>From Data to Decisions: How Zartis Empowers Businesses</b></h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zartis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we specialise in harnessing the power of AI to optimise decision-making processes.

        "content": "<p>Published by <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com\">Zartis - Software Engineering Teams &amp; Technology Consulting</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States was one of the first countries to sign a global convention to govern AI. These US AI regulations are timely and necessary because AI is evolving quickly and needs to be applied ethically, fairly, and safely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For investors looking to dive into AI businesses, it’s important to understand the regulatory landscape. Staying in the loop on AI regulations in the US is important to stay safe and earn high returns on your investments. Here is a quick overview of US AI regulation in 2025.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>The Future of AI Regulation: Key Changes and Predictions for 2025 and Beyond</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US approach to AI regulation might take a different turn in 2025. Here are some key regulatory changes to expect going forward: </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>1. AI Regulations May Change With New White House</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The return of Donald Trump as US President in 2025 hints at new directions for AI regulation in the US. The administration had earlier criticized the past administration&#8217;s approach to AI regulation calling it a “dangerous Executive Order” on AI oversight. The goal is to replace it with policies that promote “AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you dig deeper into the administration’s policy-making agenda, especially the Project 2025 report, there is a more subtle pattern. While the new administration is trying to reduce regulations in the interest of innovation, national security is still a top priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key priorities include:  </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using AI in commerce and trade enforcement. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establishing specialized teams to oversee AI policies. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasing export controls to keep foreign adversaries (especially China) out of the advanced US AI technologies. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This persistence in preventing China from having access shows that the administration considers AI a key driver of global influence. While pushing for lenient domestic regulation, the administration will likely keep it tight to ensure national security and technological supremacy at home and abroad. This double-edged approach means new laws will become more business-friendly, but crucial protections will stay.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>2. Experts Predict the Bubble May Burst for AI in 2025</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As 2025 unfolds, speculations of an “AI bubble” in tech are growing. Analysts notice that large investments in AI are yet to yield proportionate returns. </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/08/12/bear-market-is-likely-coming-in-2025-warns-veteran-investor-david-roche.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veteran investor David Roche predicts a bear market in 2025</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, partially due to smaller-than-expected rate cuts, a slowing U.S. economy, and an AI bubble. He equates today’s AI boom with the dot-com bubble and warns that deep market corrections are just around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some analysts have a more optimistic take on things. They say that strong earnings in the AI sector separate it from bubbles in the past and suggest a more resilient market. Nevertheless, AI keeps fueling technological change, but stakeholders must stay on guard. And we have to agree.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3. New Developments in New York and California Push Businesses Toward AI Transparency and Compliance</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent California and New York legislative changes are pushing businesses to be more transparent and compliant when using AI. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>California&#8217;s AI Transparency Act</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On 19 September 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law SB-942, the California AI Transparency Act. The law will be effective by January 1, 2026. It requires “Covered Providers,” meaning businesses with more than 1,000,000 monthly users, to disclose AI-based content. The Act will inform consumers that they’re engaging with AI-generated content. This transparency will promote </span><a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/the-ethics-of-ai-conversations-balancing-utility-and-privacy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ethical AI conversations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>New York&#8217;s AI Layoff Reporting Requirements</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York has become the first state to include AI-driven layoffs reporting to its Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Organizations with 50 employees or more now have to declare the number of jobs lost due to AI automation. This law will track the effect of AI on employment and ensure that workforce changes are done responsibly.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Which US Agency Regulates Artificial Intelligence?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is being regulated for various reasons, but which US agency regulates artificial intelligence? Well, there isn&#8217;t a single agency solely in charge of regulating AI in the US. Rather, AI is controlled by a mix of federal and state authorities. With rapid</span><a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/survey/state-of-ai-adoption/2024/?hsCtaAttrib=176206980917\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AI adoption in recent years</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, state governments and key industries such as healthcare, finance, and defense have developed unique AI policies. This decentralized system involves many agencies and legislative bodies:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>1. Federal Agencies</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NIST provides voluntary guidelines and standards to promote trustworthy AI systems.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FDA regulates AI applications in medical devices and healthcare. This agency has authorized almost 1000 AI-enabled medical devices.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FTC oversees AI use in consumer protection. They try to prevent deceptive practices and ensure data privacy, thus they regulate everything from customer service chatbots to facial recognition technology and so much more.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SEC monitors AI in financial markets, especially in algorithmic trading and investment tools.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>2. State Governments</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without comprehensive federal AI legislation, states are regulating some AI use cases and consumer rights. Here are some states making headway with AI regulation:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Colorado</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colorado’s </span><a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-169\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SB 21-169</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bans discriminatory insurance based on external consumer information or AI models.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Connecticut</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/ACT/PA/PDF/2022PA-00015-R00SB-00006-PA.PDF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Connecticut Privacy Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (July 2023) protects the right of consumers to choose whether to consent to AI-based profiling in automated decision-making. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Illinois</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=4015&amp;ChapterID=68\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Illinois AI Video Interview Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> requires employers to inform candidates of AI usage and explain why it&#8217;s being used in assessments. It also protects candidates&#8217; right to consent and restricts video sharing to authorized service providers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3. Legislative Developments</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of 2024, at least 45 states and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have introduced AI bills. One in three states have already passed laws on the use of AI. These figures show a growing awareness of the need for regulating this innovative technology. Given the complexity of the regulatory landscape, all levels of government and industry must collaborate to develop and deploy AI responsibly.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>What Are the Common US AI Regulations?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some popular US regulations on AI:</span></p>\n<h3><b>1. </b><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/302\"><b>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act</b></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI applications in aviation must be checked and scrutinized to ensure safety and efficiency. This legislation addresses worries about automation in air traffic management, autonomous flight systems, and other AI-based aviation technologies.</span></p>\n<h3><b>2. </b><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515\"><b>National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019</b></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This act requires the Department of Defense to manage AI projects and integrate AI into national security. It involves creating an AI coordinator to run military AI projects and ensure ethical standards are followed.</span></p>\n<h3><b>3. </b><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt617/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1210\"><b>National AI Initiative Act of 2020</b></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This law restructures AI research and development in the US. It created the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office which is charged with coordinating a national AI strategy and encouraging government, academia, and industry collaboration.</span></p>\n<h3><b>4. </b><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence\"><b>White House Executive Order on AI</b></a></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This order is called Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. It calls for the responsible use of AI across many industries. It highlights how innovation and risk management must be balanced to make the most of AI’s social and economic benefits</span></p>\n<h3><b>5. </b><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/\"><b>Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</b></a><b> </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This White House initiative outlines rules for equitable use and access to AI systems. It gives recommendations for making sure AI technologies do not support discrimination. It also ensures data privacy and transparency in AI decision-making.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Are the US AI Regulations the Same Across All States in the United States?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, the US artificial intelligence regulation varies from one state to another. Federal initiatives can give broad directions, but states have established AI laws to cater to their local concerns. This decentralized approach causes regional differences in AI regulation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California, for instance, has privacy laws (such as CCPA) that govern how AI systems handle users&#8217; data. Illinois on the other hand, has the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which protects AI-based biometric technology such as facial recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These state-by-state differences are a hurdle for AI-powered companies as they have to deal with an extremely complicated regulatory framework. It also calls for federal action to align AI regulations US while allowing states the flexibility to address unique concerns.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How Do US AI Regulations Affect AI-Driven Businesses in the United States?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US government AI regulation affects how businesses develop and operate their systems. Here are some opportunities and hurdles these regulations pose to businesses: </span></p>\n<h3><b>1. Increased Compliance Requirements</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses must ensure their AI systems meet all federal and state regulations.

His expertise lies in bridging the gap between business goals, strategy and technology, enabling organisations to adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Jack has an extensive career that spans a variety of sectors, from large corporations like IBM to smaller startups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack discusses the critical role of </span><b>culture, values, and vision</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in shaping successful teams and organisations. From his extensive work in both large corporations and smaller startups, Jack shares insights on how culture and values can drive performance, as well as the steps leaders can take to ensure their vision inspires and resonates with teams.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Insights from the Episode</b></h3>\n<h4><b>1. Culture vs. Values: What’s the Difference?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack highlights the distinction between culture and values:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Culture</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is what a team </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Values</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are what a team </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they stand for.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The key challenge is aligning the two, as disconnects between stated values and actual behaviour can lead to dissonance within the team. Jack emphasises that leadership must ensure values are not just words on a wall but principles lived and applied daily.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>2. Building and Maintaining a Strong Culture</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining culture as a company scales is a challenge many face, particularly as new people join the organisation. Jack suggests that it’s not about maintaining the same culture but rather ensuring the essential parts of it remain intact, even as the business evolves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack recommends keeping teams involved through workshops, constant reinforcement, and by fostering a shared understanding of the values during onboarding and beyond.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>3. Measuring the Impact of Culture and Values</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While measuring culture can be difficult, Jack stresses the importance of using tools like </span><b>eNPS</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (employee Net Promoter Score) and regular employee surveys to assess engagement and alignment with company values. He also points out that feedback mechanisms, like peer reviews, help keep the culture and values in check.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>4. Vision as the Guiding Light</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong vision is crucial to inspiring teams. Jack explains that leaders must regularly reinforce the vision and break it down into manageable, actionable steps to ensure everyone understands their role in achieving it. Touching on his previous experience with </span>Doctorly<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Jack explains that the company’s vision of &#8220;enabling people to live healthier lives&#8221; was wide enough to fit different missions under it, clearly communicated and applied in every decision, helping to align the entire team towards common goals.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>5. Adapting Vision During Change</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vision and culture must evolve as businesses grow or pivot. Jack describes how companies must be open to adapting their vision in response to market shifts or changes in technology. The key is to keep everyone informed and involved when changes happen to prevent alienation and ensure continued alignment.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Leadership Lessons &amp; Resources</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack shares several essential leadership lessons:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A compelling </span><b>vision</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is vital for team alignment and motivation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Values</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> must be actively lived, not just stated.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders must </span><b>communicate frequently</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making values and vision a core part of team dynamics.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of resources, Jack recommends these books:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Culture Map</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Erin Meyer (for understanding cultural differences) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://adamgrant.net/book/think-again/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think Again</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Adam Grant (for reframing decisions and leadership thinking)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819\">Team Topologies</a> by Matthew Skellton and Manuel Pais (for insights on structuring teams effectively)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, you can find a previous episode where Jack had joined us and shared his insights on the evolution of digital healthcare:</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hOnswIlzmi\"><p><a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/podcasts-story-of-software/69-digital-healthcare-evolution/\">The Evolution of Digital Healthcare &#8211; Story of Software S02E27</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\"  title=\"&#8220;The Evolution of Digital Healthcare &#8211; Story of Software S02E27&#8221; &#8212; Zartis\" src=\"https://www.zartis.com/podcasts-story-of-software/69-digital-healthcare-evolution/embed/#?secret=UrldUT2YF6#?secret=hOnswIlzmi\" data-secret=\"hOnswIlzmi\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Listen to the Story of Software on:</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-story-of-software/id1523628863?uo=4\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1vBoa64F7Lg6NOthcCqzbB\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.deezer.com/en/show/1511592\">Deezer</a>, &amp; any other podcast platform of your choice.

However, AI also presents significant sustainability challenges, primarily due to its immense computing power requirements. Some large AI models consume over </span><a href=\"https://engineeringprompts.substack.com/p/does-chatgpt-use-10x-more-energy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 times the energy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a Google search, raising concerns about their environmental impact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article explores the intersection of AI and sustainability, examining how AI’s resource demands impact the environment, the solutions being implemented to mitigate these effects, and whether AI’s contributions to solving sustainability challenges balance out its energy consumption.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>The Energy Demands of AI</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most pressing sustainability concerns surrounding AI is its energy consumption. Training large-scale AI models, such as OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3, requires substantial energy. For instance, training GPT-3 consumed approximately </span><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/cs/chatgpt-large-language-models-power-consumption?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,287 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is comparable to the annual energy consumption of about 120 average American homes.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This significant energy usage highlights the environmental impact of developing advanced AI models. Unless a breakthrough in energy consumption is achieved, the carbon footprint of AI operations is going to further increase as more businesses integrate AI into their workflows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put this into perspective:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A single AI model training run can consume as much electricity as an average UK household over several decades.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered applications contribute significantly to global electricity usage, especially in high-performance computing clusters.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data centres housing AI workloads require extensive cooling systems, which further escalate energy consumption.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How AI and Sustainability Intersect</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite AI’s significant energy demands, the technology also offers solutions to sustainability challenges by improving existing <a href=\"https://www.zartis.com/industries/cleantech-software-development/\">cleantech</a> initiatives and coming up with new ones.

The Role of AI in Finimize</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI has brought incremental efficiency gains to both engineering and content teams. From using tools like GPT-4 and Copilot for code generation to implementing no-code automations for internal processes, Finimize is actively experimenting with AI. As a result, these tools have saved time (at least an hour a day for each team member in certain departments) and increased productivity, but Matt notes the importance of maintaining accountability and understanding when to leverage AI in production systems.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Product Development Philosophy</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finimize adapts its product development frameworks to suit its growth stage and objectives. By using different frameworks and switching gears for different project needs, they are able to keep the focus on progress, without hindering innovation.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For subscription metrics: Cross-functional teams use data deep dives and iterative approaches to optimise performance.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For early-stage initiatives: A scrappier, experiment-driven approach prioritises discovery over optimisation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to the Story of Software on:</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-story-of-software/id1523628863?uo=4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1vBoa64F7Lg6NOthcCqzbB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotify</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.deezer.com/en/show/1511592\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deezer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, &amp; any other podcast platform of your choice.
